# RouteAnalysis

This repository was developed for the **Graph Mining** course during the **Spring 2025 semester**, as part of **Project 3: Route Analysis Using Paths**.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed a **subgraph of flight routes in Italy and Spain**, based on a database of airports and their connections. The objective was to apply **graph mining techniques** to uncover valuable insights into air traffic networks.

Specifically, we used:

- **Centrality algorithms** to identify key airports within the network.
- **Community detection** to reveal regional clusters and travel hubs.
- **Path-finding algorithms** to explore possible route recommendations.

This analysis allowed us to detect critical nodes, optimize connectivity, and better understand the structure of flight networks across Southern Europe.
